 Results Summary
Model	Recall	Precision	F1	AUC	Missed Falls
SVM (RBF)	99.35%	91.02%	95.00%	0.988	1 fall
XGBoost	98.69%	94.97%	96.79%	0.996	2 falls
Random Forest	98.69%	94.37%	96.49%	0.996	2 falls
Logistic Regression	97.39%	94.90%	96.13%	0.997	4 falls
🔑 Key Insights
1. For Fall Detection, SVM is the winner
99.35% recall = Only missed 1 fall out of 153!
Trade-off: Slightly lower precision (91%) means more false alarms
For safety-critical apps, false alarms are acceptable, missed falls are not
2. XGBoost is the best balanced model
98.69% recall with 94.97% precision
Smallest ONNX file (48 KB) after Logistic Regression
Best overall F1 score (96.79%)
3. All models perform excellently (>97% recall)
This suggests your feature engineering is excellent
The 9 accelerometer/gyro features capture fall patterns very well
4. For Mobile Soft Voting Ensemble
Your soft voting strategy will work great:

Final_Probability = (P_xgb + P_rf + P_lr + P_svm) / 4
If Final_Probability > 0.5 → Fall Detected
📱 Recommended Mobile Strategy
Priority	Approach	Pros	Cons
Option 1	SVM only	Highest recall (99.35%)	More false alarms
Option 2	XGBoost only	Best balance, small size (48KB)	Slightly lower recall
Option 3	Soft voting (all 4)	Most robust, averaged predictions	531KB total size
Option 4	Top 2 (SVM + XGBoost)	High recall + balance	85KB total
